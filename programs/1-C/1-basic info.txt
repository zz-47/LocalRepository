 C language :

 Created in 1972 by DENNIS RITCHE and BEL-Labs to make as operating system called UNIX which was then changed to linux.

              , was a huge development of innovation around the globe ,as from creation till now it has 
               huge imapct on our lives ,as almost all the Operating Systems (OS) and kernels are written in 
                C language because of following reasons :

            PROS:

                > C : is a statically typed procedural language .
                > C : is Mother of all languages ,inspiring syntax of C++ , C# , java , javascript , pearl and PHP
                > C : compiles directly to machine language / assembly language.
                > C : requires minimal runtime support.
                > C : is HIGH Level human language providing control over LOW Level computer assembly code.

            CONS:

                > C : is platform dependent as creates different executable on different Operating Systems.
                > C : is case sensitive / sensitive to logical errors.
