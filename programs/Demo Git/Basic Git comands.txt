                     ***  For doing changes in already existing repositories  ***
  



1 - Clone - Cloning a repository on our local machine :

     git clone <- some link ->

       /* there are two different types of cloning procedures 

         its either cloning a repository :

          > remote: remotely from github
          > Local: on computer repositories are cloned

          // we can use different protocols such as SSH / HTTP / Github Cloning
           , but we'll use HTTPS as its biginner friendly
          

            // we can change the directory by using "cd" then using the name of git folder
                

            // we can show all file using "ls" comand 
            // also we can see hidden files using "ls -a"
                                                          */


   2- Status - displays the state of the code

               git status


      // upon no changes it will show all clear state , but if we do some changes in a file 
         it will give error and asks us to add and then commit the changes

         >> there are four different types of git statuses :

      1- untracked  :
                     New files ,that git doesn't track
 
      2- modified   :
                      changed

      3- staged     :
                      file is ready to be committed
       
      4- unmodified : 
                      unchanged

       // Now to change the status to nothing has happened we'll do a 2 step process 

          1- we'll add the changes / they will be staged.
          2- we'll commit changes / it'llmake it unchanged


   3-  Add - adds new or changed files in your working directory to the git staging area.

            git add <- filename ->

          // this step is used for tracking / engaging purposes.

   4- it is the record of change .

           git commit -m "some message"

         // used to ovverride the files / save new ones.

   


     3- Push command -  push - upload local repo content to remote repo
 
              git push origin main      

 >> here git push is that we wanna push changes / local repository

>> origin means assigning address to a remote and default repostory of the authorized account on github

 // this was a direct push.


    


                  ***   For uploading your local / only on machine repository  ***    




    1- Init command - Used to create a new git repository...

          
          git init

          git remote add origin <-link->

          git remote -v                  (to verify remote)

          git branch                     (to check branch)

          git branch -M main             (To rename branch)
 
          git push origin main
