      RUNTIME POLYMORPHISM :

         
         
           Example :
            
                     Function overriding :
                                          
                                   "Function overriding is much dependent to INHERTANCE b/w parent and child classes
                            PARENT class and Child class both contain same function with different implementations".
                           
            
            
               FACT :     Parent class function is said to be overriden by Child class , as parent function is ignored
                         and child functions is read because of child object used to call the function


                        --------  ALL THE ABOVE IS DECIDED WHILE RUNTIME  --------


          Example : 

                    Virtual Functions :

                                       A Virtual function is much relevant   to   overriding  to be very specific ,

                Def :   " A virtual is a member funtion ,that you expected to be redefined in derived classes ".

                     SYNTAX :

                         Base class :

                                    virtual func() {
                                        -- code --   
                                    }


                         Derived class :

                                        func() {
                                          -- code --
                                        }
