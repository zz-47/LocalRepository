           here , "poly" stands for "multiple"   and "Morph" means "Forms".

                 Polymorphism is the ability (of OBJECT) to TAKE (DIFFERENT forms) or behave in different 
                 ways (Depending on the context of code ) in ,which they are used.


          TWO TYPES of Polymorphism :

            1 - compiletime polymorphism

            2 - runtime polymorphism 
 
          Example :-

                1- constructor overloading (using more than 2 constructors in a class)
