Shallow :

         A shallow copy of an object copies all of the member values from one object to another.

            Scenarios :

            >-> In copying an object in side a stack has no problem 

            >-> The issue in shallow copying arises ,when we allocate memory dynamically using keyword
    
                  ( new ) . i.e      (new int [5];)   will dynamically allocate memory for 5 integer type variables 

                the above dynamically allocated memory is allocated in heap (open) instead of stack(enclosed) form.
