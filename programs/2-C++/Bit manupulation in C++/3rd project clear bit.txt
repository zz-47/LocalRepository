                // clearbit is used to change a given index bit to 0.

                      n   =   0 1 0 1
                 , suppose we need to clear bit at position , i = 2.

                // now making a number to secure required index.

                    1 << i = 0 1 0 0.

                // then we take ones compliment , to flip number in 0s and 1. 

                   ~ 0 1 0 0  =  1 0 1 1
                 
                 // now we only have 0 on required position ,i = 2.
                    
                  0 1 0 1  &  1 0 1 1  =  0 0 0 1
