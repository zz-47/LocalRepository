   -----------------------------------              Linked list             -------------------------------------------

     > linked list is a linear data structure ,that stores data as list of values 
     > arrays are similar ,but different ( i.e samesame ,but diflant )
     > arrays are single blocks of memeory with partitions , while linked list consists of different blocks
       of memory connected to each other. 
     
         >> Limitations of arrays are  :

            -> fixed size 
            -> contiguous / single block of memory
            -> insertion or deletion is costly.

         >> Properties fo linked list :

            -> size can be modified 
            -> non- contiguous memory 
            -> insertion and deletion at any point is easy

               linked lists:

                  a singlllle block of list is known as node its strucrue is :

                         |      |      |
                NODE     | data | next |
                         |      |      |
                          
                          , here data stores datatypes .i.e int , float ,char etc.

                          , next is pointer , which points location of next NODE.
                             also last node will have next = null
