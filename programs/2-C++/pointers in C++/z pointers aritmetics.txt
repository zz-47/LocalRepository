 
 ---------------   Pointer Arithematics is relevant to increement,decreement ,addition or subtraction   ------------------------ 

     suppose a suorce code :


    int a = 10;
    int *aptr = &a;  ------> here its supposed value is 2000 

    aptr++; ----------> here , value of aptr will be increased  to 2004 ,because (int) datatype is of 4-bits
      cout << aptr << endl; 

     > if we use char or other datatypes then value will change according to them. 
     > decreement also does the same ,but vice versa.
     > addition  or subraction will increase or decreese value according to datatypes.
