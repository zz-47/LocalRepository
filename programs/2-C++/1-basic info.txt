C++ language :

              was created in 1979 by BJARNE STROUSTRUP , this language is everywhere from operating systems to tools
                like unrealengine 5 to compiler and virtual machines , C++ is superset of C ,as all syntax of C can be 
                 used in C++ ,but an additional thing is it has Classes and Objects , instead of structs in C.
