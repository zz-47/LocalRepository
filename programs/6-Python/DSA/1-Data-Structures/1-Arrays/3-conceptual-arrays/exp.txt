The conceptual types of Arrays applicable without both the Array module & Numpy module.

Types of conceptual Arrays :

> Fixed-size arrays:

   Arrays where the size is determined at creation and cannot be easily changed (more characteristic of the array module
    and some NumPy array creation methods).


> Dynamic-sized arrays:

  Arrays that can be resized after creation (Python lists are inherently dynamic, and NumPy arrays can be dynamically 
   resized through various operations, although it might involve creating new arrays in memory).



   Python's built-in list serves as a general-purpose sequence, when discussing "types of arrays" in Python,
    one typically refers to the specialized, often more efficient, data structures provided by the array module and,
     more commonly, the NumPy library, which offer various dimensionalities and performance characteristics suitable 
      for different applications.
