In Python, while the built-in list is a versatile and commonly used data structure that can function 
similarly to arrays in other languages, there are also dedicated "array-like" structures available, primarily
 through the array module and the NumPy library.

 Types of implementation :

 1- Based on the array module

 2- Based on NumPy (Numerical Python)

 3- Conceptual Types (applicable to both array module and NumPy)
