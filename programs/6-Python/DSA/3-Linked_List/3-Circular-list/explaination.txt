Circular Linked List :

    a variation of a standard linked list where the last node's pointer points back to the first node,
     forming a circular loop.


  Working steps (Additional) :   

    > Uni Directional :

        This type of linked list is uni directional , yet it works in a circular pattren.
       
       >> We can traverse the list in one direction only.
       >> We can't traverse the list in the reverse direction.

    > Connects Tail to head at the end :

       >> As it continues to the end of list it connects the tail to the head.
       >> It resembles to ring topology , but we're dealing with lists.
