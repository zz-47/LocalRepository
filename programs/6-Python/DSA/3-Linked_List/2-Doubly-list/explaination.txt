The differnce b/w the singly and doubly linked list is that 
 
  Doubly linked list has two pointers and is bi-directional , while singly linked list is uni-directional.

  Working steps (Additional):

  > Two Pointers Per node :

      one pointer is used to point to the previous node and the other to point to the next node.
 
  > Bi-Directional Traversal :

      The traversal of nodes is possible in both the directions :

      >> head to tail
      >> tail to head

  > Efficent Insertion and Deletion :

      insertion and deletion are done efficently in doubly linked list , and time complexity is O(1),
       while in singly it reaches O(n).
