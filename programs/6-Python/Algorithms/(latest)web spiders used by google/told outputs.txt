Running the Spider:
To run the spider, you need to replace start_url with the URL you want to crawl (e.g., https://example.com). Then, you can run the script, and it will start crawling from that URL.

Notes:
Respect Robots.txt: In real-world scenarios, you should respect the robots.txt file of websites, which specifies rules for web crawlers on what they are allowed to crawl.
Legal Considerations: Always ensure you're allowed to crawl a website based on its terms of service. Unauthorized crawling can be against the law or unethical.
Error Handling: This simple example doesn't handle errors like timeouts, retries, etc. In a production-level spider, more advanced error handling should be implemented.
