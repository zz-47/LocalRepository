The Facade Method Design Pattern in Python simplifies complex systems by providing a unified interface 
to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. This pattern helps in reducing the dependencies between clients 
and the intricate system, making the code more modular and easier to understand. By implementing the Facade 
pattern, developers can hide the complexities of the underlying system, offering a simpler and more intuitive 
interface for clients. This pattern promotes better design practices by encapsulating the system's complexity 
and providing a clean, high-level way to interact with it, enhancing maintainability and scalability.


Components of Facade Method Design Pattern

The Facade Method Design Pattern consists of several key components that work together to simplify
 interactions with complex systems. Here are the primary components:

  >> Facade:

        > Definition: A single class that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
        > Role: The facade delegates client requests to the appropriate subsystem objects without exposing the underlying complexity.

  >> Subsystem Classes:
  
        > Definition: The classes that perform the work of the system. These are the actual components that provide the functionalities.
        > Role: These classes implement the subsystem functionalities. They are not directly accessible by 
           the clients but are used internally by the facade.

  >> Facade Client:

        > Definition: The external entity that interacts with the subsystem through the facade.
        > Role: The client makes requests to the facade, which in turn calls the appropriate subsystem methods.
