The Factory Method is a creational design pattern. It provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass 
but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.Instead of using a direct constructor (new)
 to create an object, you use a method (the factory) that returns an instance of a class based on some logic.

 
 
 Advantages of using Factory method

> We can easily add new types of products without disturbing the existing client code.

> Generally, tight coupling is being avoided between the products and the creator classes and objects.

  
  
  Disadvantages of using Factory method

> To create a particular concrete product object, the client might have to sub-class the creator class.

> You end up with a huge number of small files i.e, cluttering the files.
