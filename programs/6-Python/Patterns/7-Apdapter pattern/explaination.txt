Adapter method is a Structural Design Pattern which helps us in making the incompatible objects adaptable
 to each other. The Adapter method is one of the easiest methods to understand because we have a lot of real-life
  examples that show the analogy with it. The main purpose of this method is to create a bridge between two
   incompatible interfaces. This method provides a different interface for a class. We can more easily understand 
   the concept by thinking about the Cable Adapter that allows us to charge a phone somewhere that has outlets in 
different shapes. Using this idea, we can integrate the classes that couldn't be integrated due to interface incompatibility.


Applicability

  To make classes and interfaces compatible : Adapter method is always used when we are in need to make certain classes
   compatible to communicate.

   
  Relatable to Inheritance: When we want to reuse some piece of code i.e., classes and interfaces that lack some
   functionalities, it can be done using the Adapter Method.
